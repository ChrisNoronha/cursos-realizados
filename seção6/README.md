# Contact List with Sidebar Navigation

This project is a simple web application that displays a list of 20 contacts using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The contacts are fetched from a third-party API (`randomuser.me`) and are organized into groups, with a sidebar for easy navigation.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout is built using Bootstrap, ensuring that it works well on various screen sizes.
- **Sidebar Navigation:** A fixed sidebar allows users to navigate between groups of contacts.
- **Dynamic Content:** The contact list is dynamically generated by fetching data from the `randomuser.me` API.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the basic structure of the page.
- **CSS:** Custom styles for the contact items and layout.

- **JavaScript:** To fetch contact data from the API and dynamically render the content.
